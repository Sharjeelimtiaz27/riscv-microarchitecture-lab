# riscv-microarchitecture-lab

A public research and teaching lab for designing, verifying, and formally reasoning about a RISC-V microarchitecture.

This project focuses on:

- RTL design in SystemVerilog
- Functional verification
- SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)
- Formal verification
- Security-aware microarchitectural reasoning
- Weekly learning notebooks

## Vision

This repository documents a structured journey:

1. Start from a single-cycle RV32I core.
2. Move to a pipelined microarchitecture.
3. Add assertions and formal proofs.
4. Build functional verification environments.
5. Explore security properties and microarchitectural invariants.

Each step includes:
- Clean RTL
- Assertions with explanations
- Weekly technical notes
- Design reasoning

## Why This Repository Exists

CPU design requires deep understanding of:
- Architecture
- Microarchitecture
- Timing
- Invariants
- Verification discipline

This repository is built to strengthen those skills publicly and systematically.
